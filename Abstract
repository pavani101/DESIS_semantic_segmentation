## 🌍 Abstract: Semantic Segmentation of Hyperspectral Satellite Data (DESIS)

Remote sensing is a cornerstone of modern Earth and environmental sciences, enabling large-scale analysis of our planet through spatial data captured from a distance. Among the most powerful tools in this domain is **hyperspectral imaging**, which records data across **hundreds of contiguous spectral bands**, offering unparalleled insights into surface-level variations.

This project explores the application of **deep learning and unsupervised clustering** for **semantic segmentation** on hyperspectral satellite imagery captured by the **DESIS sensor**. We compare the performance of three approaches:

- 🧠 **UNet (ResNet34 backbone)** — An encoder-decoder model that excels at learning spatial features across entire image regions.
- 🔬 **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)** — Focuses on spectral features at the pixel level across 235 bands.
- 📊 **KMeans Clustering** — An unsupervised learning approach used to cluster pixel spectral signatures, demonstrating strong baseline accuracy without the need for labeled data.

We trained and evaluated the models on a stratified set of hyperspectral samples. Evaluation methods included **classification reports**, **confusion matrices**, and **segmentation visualizations** for quantitative and qualitative insights.

### 📈 Key Findings:
- **UNet achieved 92% accuracy**, effectively segmenting land cover categories with minimal overfitting.
- The **MLP baseline** showed variable performance—strong in isolated cases but limited by inconsistencies in the ground truth masks.
- **KMeans clustering** produced **surprisingly good accuracy** for an unsupervised method, effectively grouping spectrally distinct classes like vegetation, water, and urban surfaces.
