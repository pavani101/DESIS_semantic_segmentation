# Semantic_Segmentation_of_Hyperspectral_Satellite_Images
## ðŸ“– An Overview

This project explores the application of deep learning for **semantic segmentation** on **hyperspectral imagery** captured by the DESIS sensor. By leveraging models like **UNet with a ResNet34 backbone** and a **baseline MLP**, we aim to classify and visualize land cover with high accuracy across 235 spectral bands.

ðŸ“Œ **Goal**: Compare spatial vs spectral modeling performance  
ðŸ“¡ **Data**: Hyperspectral images from DESIS  
ðŸ“Š **Models**: UNet | MLP | KMeans Clustering
ðŸŽ¯ **Best Accuracy**: 92% with UNet

ðŸ“Œ **Note:**  
This repository contains a high-level overview of the project. A more detailed description, including code and dataset annotations, is currently limited due to an ongoing **publication submission**.
